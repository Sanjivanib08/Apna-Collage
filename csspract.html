<h1>Ozaymandias</h1>
<!-- poet's Name -->
<h3>
    by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
    <!-- poem -->
    <p > I met a traveller from an antique land<br />
    who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
    stand in the desert ......" Near them, on the sand,<br />
    Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />
    And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br />
    Tell that its sculptor well those passion read,<br />
    which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
    The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br />
    And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br />
    My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, King og Kings;<br />
    Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br />
    Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
    of that colossal wrack, boundless and bare<br />
    The lone and levvel sands stretch far away."<br />
